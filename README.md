# AllEve-AI
An open-source project to integrate all aspects of EVE API, geared to be multi-platformed and with AI integration.

## Proposals
1. Provide an easy-to-use interface that allows access to the character's information. This includes, but is not limited to, character skills, inventory, and the mail system.
2. Provide intel that would notify the player of any situation that would enhance the player's experience. This would be touted as an expand Aura beyond the current Inception New Player Experience.
3. Additional features as we go.

## Development
This application will start development as a desktop application for the Windows 10 operating system. It will utilize Microsoft Cortana as a means to create an Aura AI experience. This will be a learning experience for the developer, who has yet to work on some of the technologies that will be implemented.

## The Developer
My name is Graedon Mahron, a pilot within the EvE universe. I have been working towards this task for a few years now! I have been studying within the Gallente universities, learning the necessary tools needed to develope different applications for all capsuleers to use.

## The Blog
As part of this project, I will create a blog / website to explain this project, as well as all other projects that would be developed. I may also create parts of this site to catalog my exploits across the galaxy!
